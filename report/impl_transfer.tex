\subsection{Stereo Transfer}
\label{sec:transfer}
Armed with an effective multiple exemplar $k$-NNF computation, there remains to transfer the stereoscopic information and synthesize our right frame.

\paragraph{Patch and difference transfer:} in these cases, we try two versions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a weighted average of the $N^2$ overlapping pixels of the top layer of the $k$-NNF
	\item a weighted average of the $kN^2$ overlapping pixels
\end{itemize}
We use a Gaussian mask with $N=7$, $\sigma=1$ to avoid excessive blurring.

\paragraph{Disparity transfer:} we transfer it by simply warping our left image $L'$ according to the disparity between $L$ and $R$ computed from the $k$-NNF.

To compute the disparity of each database pair, we used Classic-NL~\cite{Deqing10} for which a fast and simple Matlab/C++ implementation exists.
We also tried to implement our own disparity computation using Patch Match and it turned out to be have a higher resolution (with unwanted extra noise).

\paragraph{Disparity computation with Patch Match} several Patch Match-based methods have appeared in the Middlebury evaluations~\cite{Scharstein02}, with a generally faster runtime and good error evaluations~\cite{Bleyer11, Heise13, Jiangbo13, Besse14}.
Extending our Patch Match implementation to compute disparity is simple, we simply modified our set of candidate proposals with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Uniform Horizontal Sampling}: uniform sampling with a horizontal constraint
	\item \emph{Random Horizontal Sampling}: random sampling with a decreasing window, and a horizontal constraint
	\item \emph{Propagation}: as usual (we allow vertical deviation by a few pixels)
	\item \emph{Random Propagation}: propagates the disparity from a uniformly sampled patch
	\item \emph{Local Mean}: uses the weighted average of samples around the current patch (considering only the one-ring neighborhood gives the best results)
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we vote the disparity by constraining the maximum motion to the 97.5 percentile of disparities within the resulting image (to remove spurrious noise).
While such method is not as smooth and doesn't compare to state-of-the-art disparity computations, it produces higher resolution disparity maps than Classic-NL, for a much faster runtime than the current state-of-the-art methods (only a few tens of seconds for 4M pixel images using a $k$-NNF with $k=7$).
