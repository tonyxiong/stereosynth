\subsection{Stereo Transfer}
\label{sec:transfer}
Armed with an effective multiple exemplar $k$-NNF computation, there remains to transfer the stereoscopic information and synthesize our right frame.

\paragraph{Patch and difference transfer:} we first reduce the $k$-NNF into a single best-layer NNF, and we then use a simple voting strategy with a $7\times 7$ Gaussian mask ($\sigma=1$) for the weight of each overlapping patch so as to reduce blurring.

\paragraph{Disparity transfer:} we transfer it by simply warping our left image $L'$ according to the disparity between $L$ and $R$..

To compute the disparity of each database pair, we used Classic-NL~\cite{Deqing10} for which a fast and simple Matlab/C++ implementation exists.
We also tried to implement our own disparity computation using Patch Match and it turned out to have a higher resolution. However some results were too noisy to be useful.

\paragraph{Disparity computation with Patch Match} several Patch Match-based methods have appeared in the Middlebury evaluations~\cite{Scharstein02}, with a generally fast runtime and good error evaluations~\cite{Bleyer11, Heise13, Jiangbo13, Besse14}.
Extending our Patch Match implementation to compute disparity is simple, we simply modified our set of candidate proposals with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Uniform Horizontal Sampling}: uniform sampling with a horizontal constraint
	\item \emph{Random Horizontal Sampling}: random sampling with a decreasing window, and a horizontal constraint
	\item \emph{Propagation}: as usual (we allow vertical deviation by only a few pixels)
	\item \emph{Random Propagation}: propagates the disparity from a uniformly sampled patch
	\item \emph{Local Mean}: uses the weighted average of samples around the current patch (considering only the one-ring neighborhood gives the best results)
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we vote the disparity by constraining the maximum motion to the 97.5 percentile of disparities within the resulting image (to remove spurious noise).
While such method is not as smooth and doesn't compare to state-of-the-art disparity computations, it produces higher resolution disparity maps than Classic-NL, for an acceptable running time (only a few tens of seconds for mega-pixel images using a $k$-NNF with $k=7$).
