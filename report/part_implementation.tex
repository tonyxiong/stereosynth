\section{Implementation}

We provide details about the nearest neighbor computation with Patch Match~\cite{Barnes09} and its multiple exemplar version, borrowing ideas from Patch Web~\cite{Barnes11}. We present our patch selection using GIST.
Finally, we mention details about the different transfer strategies and discuss the frame disparity computation.

Along this section, we assume that the input frame $L'$ is the left frame and we find a k-NNF from its patches to patches within the left images $L$ of our database.
The database also contains the corresponding right frames $R$ and our goal is to eventually synthesize $R'$ from $L'$.

We assume our images to have $4$ channels: the usual $L+a+b$ from CIELAB that provide perceptually-motivated L2 distances, as well as an extra $y$ channel that encodes the location of pixels within the image, which accounts for disparity being usually larger at the bottom of images than at the top (this helps convergence).
All the channels are normalized to be within $[0;1]$.
